		<h1>A importância da língua inglesa na sociedade moderna</h1>
		<p>
			It was many and many a year ago,<br>
			In a kingdom by the sea,<br>
			That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br>
			By the name of Annabel Lee;<br>
			And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
			Than to love and be loved by me.<br>
			<br>

			I was a child and she was a child,<br>
			In this kingdom by the sea;<br>
			But we loved with a love that was more than love—<br>
			I and my Annabel Lee;<br>
			With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven<br>
			Coveted her and me.<br>
			<br>
			And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>
			In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
			A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>
			My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
			So that her highborn kinsman came<br>
			And bore her away from me,<br>
			To shut her up in a sepulchre<br>
			In this kingdom by the sea.<br>
			<br>
			The angels, not half so happy in heaven,<br>
			Went envying her and me—<br>
			Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,<br>
			In this kingdom by the sea)<br>
			That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br>
			Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.<br>
			<br>
			But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br>
			Of those who were older than we—<br>
			Of many far wiser than we—<br>
			And neither the angels in heaven above,<br>
			Nor the demons down under the sea,<br>
			Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br>
			Of the beautifulAnnabel Lee.<br>
			<br>
			For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams<br>
			Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
			And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes<br>
			Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
			And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br>
			Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,<br>
			In the sepulchre there by the sea,<br>
			In her tomb by the sounding sea.<br>
